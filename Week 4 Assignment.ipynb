The City of Fredericton provides open data for everyone and encourages entrepreneurial use to develop services for the benefit of its ciitzens.\n\nDevelopers and policy makers have an interest in answering the following questions:\n\nWhat neighbourhoods have the highest crime?\nIs population density correlated to crime level?\nUsing Foursquare data, what venues are most common in different locations within the city?\nDoes the Knowledge Park really need a coffee shop?"
